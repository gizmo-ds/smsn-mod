Block common mods from connecting to the internet without affecting the mods' functionality, preventing slow loading or
game crashes caused by network issues.

## Why This Mod Exists?

Because in certain regions with strict network censorship, accessing specific websites is impossible. For example, in
China, websites like Patreon and GitHub are blocked and cannot be accessed normally. However, some popular mods, such as
Quark, have included code that requests these websites, and when these requests fail, it can cause the game to stutter
or crash. These issues typically occur during server startup or when players join. This mod was created to solve this
problem by blocking such network requests, improving game stability for players in affected regions.

- [Quark#3416](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark/issues/3416)

A few months ago, I noticed that my Minecraft server was taking nearly 10 minutes to start each time. After
investigating, I discovered that Quark was causing this issue. Upon searching the issue tracker, I found that the author
of Quark refused to address this problem, which led me to develop this mod to resolve it.

## Features

For Forge/NeoForge: Set `versionCheck = false` in `config/fml.toml` to disable the loader's update checker.  
For Fabric with ModMenu: Set `"update_checker": false` in `config/modmenu.json` to disable ModMenu's update checks.

## F.A.Q

1. Will XX Minecraft version be supported?  
   The author can only guarantee maintenance for current mainstream versions and versions the author actively plays.
2. Can I include `Save My Shaky Network` in a modpack?  
   ✅ Yes! It's recommended to
   use [Modrinth .mrpack](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802351-modrinth-modpack-format-mrpack) or CurseForge
   modpack ZIP format.  
   ❌ Do not directly include the mod binary (`.jar`) in your modpack—prioritize user security.
